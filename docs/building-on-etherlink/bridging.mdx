title: Bridging tokens
---

You can move tokens in and out of Etherlink through a process called _bridging_.
Different bridging processes move different kinds of tokens.
See the following pages for information about the kind of token that you want to bridge:

- [Bridging tez (XTZ) between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink](./bridging-xtz)

## Bridges

Etherlink developers have created bridges for different situations.
These bridges are trustless and permissionless; anyone can use them without restrictions or the intervention of a third party.

Bridge name | Description | Mainnet link | Testnet link
--- | --- | --- | ---
Canonical bridge | Bridges tez (XTZ) tokens from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink and back | https://bridge.etherlink.com/ | https://testnet.bridge.etherlink.com/
Wrapped asset bridge | Bridges assets from EVM chains to wrapped assets on Etherlink and back | https://www.etherlinkbridge.com/bridge | Not available on Etherlink Testnet
Financial asset bridge | Bridges FA1.2 and FA2 [standards-compliant tokens](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens) from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink and back | TODO | TODO

- Bridging tokens from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink is referred to as _depositing_ tokens.
- Bridging tokens from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1 is referred to as _withdrawing_ tokens.

:::note Bridging time
Tokens that you bridge from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink, including tez and FA-compatible tokens, are available for use on Etherlink immediately.

Tokens that you bridge from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1, including tez and FA-compatible tokens, are available for use on Tezos in two weeks.

This delay is caused by the [Smart Rollup refutation period](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/smart-rollups#refutation-periods).
As with all Smart Rollups, Etherlink nodes post commitments about their state to Tezos layer 1, including incoming bridging transactions, on a regular schedule.
Other nodes have the length of the refutation period (14 days) to challenge those commitments.
At the end of the refutation period, the correct commitment is _cemented_, or made final and unchangeable.
Users can execute the bridging transactions in a commitment only after the commitment is cemented.

The Etherlink indexer run by Nomadic Labs automatically executes these bridging transactions when they are cemented, which makes the bridged tokens available on Tezos.
