title: '‚ùì What is Etherlink?'
---

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible layer-2 blockchain with a decentralized sequencer, offering very low fees and MEV protection, powered by Tezos Smart Rollup technology.

* **Decentralized üåê:** The decentralized sequencer reduces the risk of centralized control and manipulation.
* **Secure üîí:** Built-in MEV protection protects users against exploitation.
* **Low fees üí∞ :** Think &#36;0.01 per transaction, not &#36;20.

Etherlink uses Smart Rollups on the decentralized [Tezos](https://tezos.com) protocol for data availability and will expand to use the Tezos [Data Availability Layer](https://spotlight.tezos.com/data-availability-layer-dal-what-is-it-all-about/).

## What does that mean?

* **EVM compatible**: Etherlink runs all Solidity/Vyper smart contracts just like any other EVM chain. All your developer tooling (including [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), and [Viem](https://viem.sh)) should work out-of-the-box with Etherlink.
* **Smart Rollup**: Smart Rollups are Tezos's permissionless L2 scaling solution. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in. They are optimistic and enshrined:
  * **Optimistic** means that when rollup operators publish a claim about the state of the rollup, the claim is trusted by default. Other operators can easily verify and challenge the claim, and a single honest operator is enough to ensure that the rollup is running honestly.
  * **Enshrined** means that they are implemented as a first-class operation at the protocol level within L1 Tezos, as opposed to using a smart contract on L1 like current Ethereum solutions.
* **Data availability on Tezos**: Smart Rollups store data on Tezos layer 1, making it available to everyone.

## Why use Etherlink?

### It's fast

Tezos's 2-block finality guarantee and the speed of its Smart Rollups ensure that transactions are finalized quickly.
Leveraging the latest research with a modified implementation of [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05677) with [Shoal](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/shoal-how-we-reduce-bullshark-latency-on-the-aptos-blockchain-44a600d977a1), Etherlink is low latency, with sub-second confirmation times:

<table><thead><tr><th width="170">Chain</th><th width="141.33333333333331">Sequencer</th><th>L2 finality time</th><th>Data posted on L1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Etherlink</td><td>Decentralized</td><td>~ 750ms</td><td>~ 15 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Optimism Bedrock</td><td>Centralized</td><td>~ <a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#blocks">2 seconds</a></td><td>~ <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/batches">2 minutes</a></td></tr><tr><td>Arbitrum One</td><td>Centralized</td><td>~ <a href="https://arbiscan.io/">300ms</a></td><td>~ <a href="https://arbiscan.io/batches">7 minutes</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### It's decentralized

Etherlink's decentralized sequencer provides high availability and resistance to attacks.
If the sequencing fails, users have an option to submit to the L1 directly after a delay.

### It's cheap

Etherlink is built on Tezos Smart Rollups, which are enshrined on the platform, meaning that they are implemented directly on layer 1 of the protocol.
However, because Smart Rollups run in their own separate environments, they are not subject to the per-transaction gas fees of layer 1, only small fees when they publish their state to layer 1.
At a load of 50TPS, you can expect an ERC-20 transaction to cost $0.01 or less on Etherlink.

Smart Rollups also provide standardized communication between layer 1 and other rollups, even those with different execution environments, such as EVM, Michelson, and SVM.
They can retrieve data from outside the Tezos blockchain via the reveal data channel.
