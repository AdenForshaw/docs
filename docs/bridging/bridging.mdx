You can move tokens in and out of Etherlink through a process called _bridging_.
See these related pages for more information:

- [Bridging tokens between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink](/bridging/bridging-tezos), including XTZ and tokens that are compliant with the FA standard
- [Bridging tokens between Etherlink and other EVM networks](/bridging/bridging-evm) such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Optimism, Base, and BNB Chain

## Bridges

Etherlink developers have created bridges for different situations.
These bridges are trustless and permissionless; anyone can use them without restrictions or the intervention of a third party.
