[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) provides a series of tools to make developing dApps easier.

## Safe

[Etherlink Safe](https://safe.etherlink.com) is an Etherlink implementation of [Safe\{Wallet\}](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web), which manages multi-signature smart contracts (multisigs).
Multisigs require signatures from two or more accounts before running transactions, which can provide additional security for accounts or require multiple parties to agree to a transaction.
Etherlink Safe helps you create multisigs, select the accounts that can sign transactions, and set the number of signatures required to run a transaction.
It also helps manage transactions that are waiting for signatures.
